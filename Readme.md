# GO-DSV
> A delimited separated values package for Golang that generate a single line with structs data

**Under development**

## How to use

- Create a struct and include flags to each field. Example:
```
type myTestStruct struct {
  FieldOne string `index:"1" length:"50" paddingChar:"0"`
  FieldTwo string `index:"3" length:"50"`
  FieldThree string `index:"2"`
}
```

### What tags are supported?

- `index` represents the position of each field in the generated line.
- `length` represents the length of the field in the line.
- `paddingChar` represents what char will be placed in the empty space until the length be achieved. Default is empty space.
